LIV_Android
===========
Background
LIV is a startup whose mission is to bring excitement and value to people’s daily experiences. We provide deal-of-the-day service that features discounted gift certificates usable at local or national companies. We combine Vine and Groupon to make shopping more interesting.
At present, there’re lots of deal apps like Groupon, LivingSocial, AmazonLocal and deal- aggregator Yipit. Normally, these Groupon-like apps use picture flow to show deals, in LIV, we use video flow (like in Vine, a short 6 second video clip), which is a fantastic way to attract attention and increase interaction between deal provider and consumer.
