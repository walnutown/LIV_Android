LIV_Android
===========
##Background
LIV is a startup whose mission is to bring excitement and value to people’s daily experiences. We provide deal-of-the-day service that features discounted gift certificates usable at local or national companies. We combine Vine and Groupon to make shopping more interesting.<br>
At present, there’re lots of deal apps like Groupon, LivingSocial, AmazonLocal and deal- aggregator Yipit. Normally, these Groupon-like apps use picture flow to show deals, in LIV, we use video flow (like in Vine, a short 6 second video clip), which is a fantastic way to attract attention and increase interaction between deal provider and consumer.

##Project Progress
The app hasn't been finished yet.
  * Parts have been completed
      * sliding menu (Create a sliding menu using animation and drawables)
      * login-register module (json transfer between server and client, client-side local storage)
      * deal page (display a list of deals and automate the playback of video while the page is scrolled)
      * Style the finished parts of the app
